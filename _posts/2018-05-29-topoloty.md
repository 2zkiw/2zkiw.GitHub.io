# Open / Closed

## Open ball: 
Let x $\in$ $R^n$ and r > 0 a real number. Define the open ball of radius r at the point x as
<center>
Br(x) := {y $\in$ $R^n$ : ||x - y|| < r}.
</center>

## Bounded:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is bounded if there exists an r > 0 such that S $\subseteq$ $B_{r}$(0).

- Notice: An open ball is bounded.

## Interior Point:
Let S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ be an arbitrary set.
x $\in$ $R^n$ is an interior point of S if **there exists** an r > 0 such that $B_{r}$(x) $\subseteq$ S. 

## Boundary Point:
Let S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ be an arbitrary set.
x $\in$ $R^n$ is a boundary point of S if **for every** r > 0, $B_{r}$(x) $\cap$ S $\neq$ $\emptyset$ and $B_{r}$(x) $\cap$ $S^{c}$ $
\neq$ $\emptyset$.

- Notice: $\partial$ Q = R.

## Open Set:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is open if every point of S is an interior point. i.e. S is open if for every x $\in$ S there exists an r > 0 such that $B_{r}$(x) $\subseteq$ S.

## Closed Set:
A set S is closed if $S^c$ is open.

## Propositoin:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is closed $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\partial$ S $\subseteq$ S.

### Prove a set S is open:
- By definition
- Show that $S^c$ is closed
- By Continuity

## Closureï¼š
If S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ then the closure of S is the set $\bar{S}$ = S $\cup$ $\partial$ S.

## Propositoin:
- $\bar{S}$ is always a closed set.
- S is closed $\Longleftrightarrow$ S = $\bar{S}$
- $\bar{S}$ is the smallest clsed set containing S.

# Sequence in R:
A map x: N -> R. Notation: $(x_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty}$.

## Subsequence:
Given a sequence x: N -> R and an increasing map n: N -> N, a subsequence is the sequence formed by the compostion x(n(k)). Notation: $x_{n_{k}}$.

- Method: extracting elements from the original sequence while keeping them in the same order

- Notice: $x_{n_{k}}$ means that the kth element in the subsequence is the $n_{k}$ th element in the original element.

## Bounded Sequence:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in R.
$(x_{n})$ is bounded if there exists an M > 0 such that |$x_{n}$| $\leq$ M for every n $\in$ N.

## Increasing(Decreasing) Sequence:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in R.
$(x_{n})$ is increasing if $x_{n+1}$ > $x_{n}$($x_{n+1}$ < $x_{n}$) for every n$\in$ N.

## Convergence:
If $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in R, $(x_{n})$ 
converges with limit L, $(x_{n}) \overset{n\rightarrow\infty}L$, if **for every** $\epsilon$ > 0 there exists an N $\in$ N such that whenever n > N, |$\x_{n}$ - L| < $\epsilon$.

## Proposition:
If $x_{n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in R such that ($x_{n}$) -> x and ($x_{n}$) -> y then x = y. i.e. Limits of convergent sequences are unique.

- **Proof Method**: Triangle Inequality + $\fraction{\epsilon}{2}$ + max{N1, N2}

## Limit Laws for Sequences

Let($a_{n}$) -> L and ($b_{n}$) -> M be convergent sequences.
- The sequence ($a_{n}$ + $b_{n}$) is convergent and ($a_{n}$ + $b_{n}$) -> L + M
- The sequence ($a_{n}$ $b_{n}$) is convergent and ($a_{n}$ $b_{n}$) -> LM.
- For any $\alpha$ $\in$ R the sequence $(\alpha a_{n})$ converges and ($\alpha$ $a_{n}$) -> $\alpha$ L
- If M $\neq$ 0 then the sequence($\fraction{a_{n}{b_{n}}}$ converges and ($\fraction{a_{n}{b_{n}}}$) -> L/M

- **Common Proof Method for $\epsilon - \delta$**: Triangle Inequality + $\fraction{\epsilon}{2}$ + max{N1, N2}

## Squeeze Theorem for Sequences (in R)
Let ($a_{n}$), ($b_{n}$) and ($c_{n}$) be sequences in R, and assume that for sufficiently large k we have $a_{n} \leq b_{n} \leq c_{n}$. If ($a_{n}$) -> L and ($c_{n}$) -> L, then ($b_{n}$) is also convergent with limit L.

## Monotone Convergence Theorem:

If ($a_{n}$) is bounded from above an non-decreasing, then ($a_{n}$) is convergent with its limit given by sup{$a_{n}$: n $\in$ N}.

### The Completeness Axiom:
Let S be a nonempty set of real numbers. If S has an upper bound then S has a least upper bound, called the supremum of S and denoted by sup S. If S has a lower bound, then S has a greatest lower bound, called the infimum of S and denoted by inf S.

If S has no upper bound, define sup S to be +$\infty$, and if S has no lower bound, define inf S to be -$\infty$.

**Supremeum**:
If S has an upper bound the number a = supS is the unique number such that:
- x $\leq$ a for every x $\in$ S and 
- for every $\epsilon$ > 0 there exists x $\in$ S with x > a - $\epsilon$.

## Nested Interval Theorem
For each k $\in$ N, let $I_{k}$ = [$a_{k}$, $b_{k}$] be a closed interval such that
<center>
$I_{1}$ $\supseteq$ $I_{2}$ $\supseteq$ $I_{3} $\supseteq$ $I_{4}$ $\supseteq$ ... $\supseteq$ $I_{k}$ $\supseteq$ ...
</center>
is a nested collection of intervals, and ($b_{k}$ - $a_{k}$) $\overset{}$

## Proposition:
If $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ -> x is a convergent sequence, then every subsequence ($x_{n_{k}}$) is also convergent with the same limit.(i.e. the same N works for $x_{n_{k}}$).

# Sequence in $R^n$

## Convergence:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $R^{n}$. Say ($x_{n}$) converges with limit x $\in$ $R^{n}$, denoted ($x_{n}$) -> x, if for every $\epsilon$ > 0 there exists an N $\in$ N such that whenever n > N then ||$x_{n}$ - x|| < $\epsilon$.

## Proposition:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in $R^{m}$ and write $x_{n}$ = ($x_{n}^{1}$,..., $x_{n}^{m}$). ($x_{n}$) converges $\Longleftrightarrow$ ($x_{n}^{i}$) converges for i = 1,..., m.

## Proposition:
If S $\subseteq$ $R^{n}$, then x $\in$ $\bar{S}$ $\Longleftrightarrow$ **there exists** a convergent sequence ($x_{n}$) in S such that (x_{n}) -> x.

- Note: If S $\subseteq$ $R^n$, define ($x_{n}$) a sequence in S if $x_{n}$ $\in$ S for every n $\in$ N. 

- **Common proof method**: construct a sequence converges to x by construction $x_{n}$ $\in$ $B_{\fraction{1}{n}}$(x) and choose N s.t. $\fraction{1}{n}$ < $\epsilon$.


## Corollary:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is closed $\Longleftrightarrow$ **whenever** $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a convergent sequence in S

The closure of S is the collection of all limit points of convergent sequences in S.
