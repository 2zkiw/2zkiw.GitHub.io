# Open / Closed

## Open ball: 
Let x $\in$ $R^n$ and r > 0 a real number. Define the open ball of radius r at the point x as
<center>
Br(x) := {y $\in$ $R^n$ : ||x - y|| < r}.
</center>

## Bounded:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is bounded if there exists an r > 0 such that S $\subseteq$ $B_{r}$(0).

- Notice: An open ball is bounded.

## Interior Point:
Let S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ be an arbitrary set.
x $\in$ $R^n$ is an interior point of S if **there exists** an r > 0 such that $B_{r}$(x) $\subseteq$ S. 

## Boundary Point:
Let S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ be an arbitrary set.
x $\in$ $R^n$ is a boundary point of S if **for every** r > 0, $B_{r}$(x) $\cap$ S $\neq$ $\emptyset$ and $B_{r}$(x) $\cap$ $S^{c}$ $
\neq$ $\emptyset$.

- Notice: $\partial$ Q = R.

## Open Set:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is open if every point of S is an interior point. i.e. S is open if for every x $\in$ S there exists an r > 0 such that $B_{r}$(x) $\subseteq$ S.

## Closed Set:
A set S is closed if $S^c$ is open.

## Propositoin:
A set S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ is closed $\Longleftrightarrow$ $\partial$ S $\subseteq$ S.

### Prove a set S is open:
- By definition
- Show that $S^c$ is closed
- By Continuity

## Closureï¼š
If S $\subseteq$ $R^n$ then the closure of S is the set $\bar{S}$ = S $\cup$ $\partial$ S.

## Propositoin:
- $\bar{S}$ is always a closed set.
- S is closed $\Longleftrightarrow$ S = $\bar{S}$
- $\bar{S}$ is the smallest clsed set containing S.

## Sequence:
A map x: N -> R. Notation: $(x_{n})_{n=0}^{\infty}$.

## Subsequence:
Given a sequence x: N -> R and an increasing map n: N -> N, a subsequence is the sequence formed by the compostion x(n(k)). Notation: $x_{n_{k}}$.

- Method: extracting elements from the original sequence while keeping them in the same order

- Notice: $x_{n_{k}}$ means that the kth element in the subsequence is the $n_{k}$ th element in the original element.

## Bounded Sequence:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in R.
$(x_{n})$ is bounded if there exists an M > 0 such that |$x_{n}$| $\leq$ M for every n $\in$ N.

## Increasing(Decreasing) Sequence:
Let $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ be a sequence in R.
$(x_{n})$ is increasing if $x_{n+1}$ > $x_{n}$($x_{n+1}$ < $x_{n}$) for every n$\in$ N.

## Convergence:
If $(x_{n})_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence in R, $(x_{n})$ 
converges with limit L, $(x_{n}) \overset{n\rightarrow\infty}L$
